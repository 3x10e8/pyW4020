    "## Problem 1: PRC of Connor-Stevens Neuron Model (Winfree's Method)\n",
    "In this problem, you are asked to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement Winfree's method for approximating the Phase Response Curve (PRC) for Voltage of the CSN Model. Use simple words to describe the procedures and your method. \n",
    "2. Generate spike train with Connor-Stevens neuron and the I/O equivalent project-integrate-and-fire (PIF) neuron when the input is [$I_{ext}(t)$](#note-on-I-ext). Use simple words to describe your implementation of PIF. \n",
    "    - **Note**: You should compare the inter-spike-interval of the CSN model and the PIF model. \n",
    "3. Evaluate the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$ of the difference between the corresponding spike times of the Connor-Stevens neuron and the equivalent PIF neuron for bandlimited stimulus described by [equation](#input) scaled to have maximum amplitude $c > 0$ (i.e. $\\max_{t}|u(t)| = c$). Plot these statistics as a function of $c$ across values of $c$. \n",
    "    - **Note 1**: You should generate new inputs $u(t)$ (with different random coefficients) to ensure that the error statistics is not biased by the form of the input stimulus. \n",
    "    - **Note 2**: The value of $c$ should not be so large that the limit cycle of the ConnorStevens model collapses into singularity. It would be instructive to look at F-I curve of the ConnorStevens model first to find a range of input current values that gives periodic spiking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on $I_{ext} = I + u(t)$ <a name=\"note-on-I-ext\"/>\n",
    "Starting this homework, the injected current to model neurons $I_{ext}$ will have this form $I+u(t)$, where $I$ refers to _injected current_ (or _bias_ current) and $u(t)$ is the _stimulus_. \n",
    "The ideas is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $I$: injected (bias) current is a _constant_ value for all time that is injected to the neuron model. You can consider this value as the _average_/DC value of the input $I_{ext}$. Since this value is not time-varying, it contains _no information_ (in the sense of entropy). For this reason, we don't use refer to $I$ as _stimulus_. However, the bias $I$ will change the shape of the limit cycle $\\Gamma$ (or the periodic solution ${\\bf x}^0$) of the neuron model, where the higher the bias current $I$, the smaller the limit cycle and the faster the neuron oscillates. For this reaso, we can consider the dynamic of the neuron model to be _parametrized_/_indexed_ by the bias $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $u(t)$: this is a time-varying signal that has information content. If we consider $I$ as the DC value of $I_{ext}$, then $u(t)$ will be a zero-mean signal that corresponds to local perturbation of the neuron dynamic around the limit cycle $\\Gamma$. This is the input signal that we seeks to decode from the neuron spike times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Stimulus $u(t)$ - Complex Exponential <a name=\"input\"></a>\n",
    "The input stimulus here is a zero-DC valued complex exponential of order $M=5$ on support $t\\in[-50, 200]$ ms with bandwidth $\\Omega = 2\\pi \\cdot 20 \\quad [rad\\cdot s^-1]$,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(t)= \\sum^{M}_{m=-M}a_{m} \\exp\\left(j\\frac{m\\Omega t}{M}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a uniform random number generate to obtain the complex coefficients, e.g. `rand` for the $a_{m},m=-M,\\ldots,M$.\n",
    "Note that for stimulus $u(t)$ to be real-valued signal, the coefficients $a_m$ need to be conjugate-symmetric. In another word, $a_m = \\overline{a_{-m}} = Re(a_{-m}) - j Im(a_{-m})$, \n",
    "where $Re(\\cdot), Im(\\cdot)$ calculates the _real_ and _imagninary_ parts of the complex number respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stimulus $u(t)$ should be zero-DC valued, which means that $a_0 = 0$. An example of generating these coefficients is given below:\n",
    "```MATLAB\n",
    "am_right = rand(5,1) + 1i * rand(5,1);\n",
    "a_m = [conj(flip(am_right)); 0; am_right];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This input stimulus $u(t)$ is additively coupled into a periodically spiking Connor-Stevens neuron (kernel code is provided)."
